## tip

## [v0.7.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaTraces/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

Released at 2026-01-24

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaTraces](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/) and vtstorage in [VictoriaTraces cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/cluster/): adjust `-insert.indexFlushInterval` from 30s to 20s to ensure a proper time gap with `-search.latencyOffset`. This is useful when ingest data is not real-time, as it helps reduce the probability that data can be searched by condition but is not present in the traceID index, resulting in failure to query by traceID.

* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaTraces](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/) and vtselect in [VictoriaTraces cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/cluster/): fix backward compatibility for the old index format. Previously, the old index format was not parsed correctly into the start and end timestamps.

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaTraces/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

Released at 2026-01-21

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaTraces](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/) and [VictoriaTraces cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/cluster/): add duration and error metrics for service graph background tasks. Thank @chenlujjj for [the pull request #100](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaTraces/pull/100).
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaTraces](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/) and [VictoriaTraces cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/cluster/): add accurate start time and end time to the trace ID index. This should help with the trace lookup by ID, and will free user from configuring `-search.traceMaxDurationWindow` to avoid missing the spans. See [the pull request #81](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaTraces/pull/81).

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaTraces/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

Released at 2026-01-07

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.25.4 to Go1.25.5. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.25.5](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.5%20label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [logstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): upgrade VictoriaLogs dependency from [v1.38.0 to v1.43.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/compare/v1.38.0...v1.43.1).
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaTraces](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/) and vtinsert in [VictoriaTraces cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriatraces/cluster/): reduce CPU usage of the OpenTelemetry protobuf data ingestion in both OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC APIs. Thanks to @vadimalekseev for [the initial idea](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/pull/720).
